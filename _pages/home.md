Welcome to my personal website :)

I am a first-year PostDoc Fellow doing Gravitational Wave Astrophysics at the New York University. I recently finished my PhD at the University of Zurich under the advise of <a href= "https://www.astro.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Lucio-Mayer.html" target="_blank">Lucio Mayer</a>. I am mainly interested in using GWs from inspiraling Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) to not only probe source properties but also constrain their environment, especially in the context of the future space-based GWs detection mission <a href= "https://www.elisascience.org/" target="_blank">LISA</a>, adopted by ESA and supported by NASA in 2024. Moreover, I would like to understand how well optical surveys <a href= "https://www.lsst.org/" target="_blank">LSST</a> and <a href= "https://science.nasa.gov/mission/roman-space-telescope/Roman " target="_blank">Roman</a> can find LISA MBHBs.
