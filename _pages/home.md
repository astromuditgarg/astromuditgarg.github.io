Welcome to my personal website :)

I am a first-year PostDoc Fellow doing Astrophysics at the New York University. I am funded by the <a href= https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/235363 target="_blank">Swiss Mobility grant</a> and hosted by  <a href= https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/andrew-macfadyen.html target="_blank"> Andrew MacFadyen</a>. I recently finished my PhD at the University of Zurich under the advise of <a href= "https://www.astro.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Lucio-Mayer.html" target="_blank">Lucio Mayer</a>. I am mainly interested in using GWs from inspiraling Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) to not only probe source properties but also constrain their environment, especially in the context of the future space-based GWs detection mission <a href= "https://www.elisascience.org/" target="_blank">LISA</a>, adopted by ESA and supported by NASA in 2024. Moreover, I would like to understand how well optical surveys <a href= "https://www.lsst.org/" target="_blank">LSST</a> and <a href= "https://science.nasa.gov/mission/roman-space-telescope/Roman " target="_blank">Roman</a> can find MBHBs.
