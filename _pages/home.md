Welcome to my personal website :)

I am a first-year PostDoc Fellow doing Gravitational Wave Astrophysics at the New York University. I am mainly interested in using GWs from inspiraling massive black hole binaries to not only probe source properties but also constrain their environment, especially in the context of the future space-based GWs detection mission <a href= "https://www.elisascience.org/" target="_blank">LISA</a>, adopted by ESA and supported by NASA in 2024.
